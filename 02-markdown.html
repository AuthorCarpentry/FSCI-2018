<h1>Introduction to RMarkdown for Reproducible Reporting</h1>

<p>90 minutes</p>

<hr />

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Identify characteristics of reproducible reports based on a published example provided in class</li>
<li>Review the evolution of the computational narrative (aka literate programming) as a precursor to reproducible reporting</li>
<li>Create a simple Rmarkdown document with code chunks in RStudio (as a first building block of a reproducible report)</li>
<li>Explain the technology stack used to create a reproducible report in RStudio</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anatomy of an RMarkdown Reproducible Report</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to start building your own Reproducible Report! The course instructors have prepared all the content as text and script files, so you can focus on learning Rmarkdown. Let&rsquo;s go step by step:</p>

<h4>Step 1.</h4>

<p>In RStudio, navigate through the <code>Files</code> directory to the <code>FSCI-2018/data</code> subfolder and open the exercise file <code>Base_2013_day2_in.Rmd</code>. Immediately save it as <code>Base_2013_day2_out.Rmd</code> and close the &lsquo;in&rsquo; file. We will  continue to work on the &lsquo;out&rsquo; file during this lesson.  By the end of the course, that &lsquo;out&rsquo; file will be ready to publish online, showcasing your open authoring skills!</p>

<h4>Step 2. Note that the <code>.Rmd</code> exercise file has three main components:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><code>YAML Header</code>
YAML (&ldquo;Not Another Markdown Language&rdquo;) contains document metadata that <code>knitr</code> and <code>pandoc</code> need to properly render the document and produce an output file. The header is set off with three dashes <code>---</code> above and below. Make sure there is  a blank line between the <code>YAML</code> header and the rest of the document.</p></li>

<li><p>The main body of the text contains the content you compose and markup with <code>Rmarkdown</code> syntax to clarify its meaning and polish its appearance.</p></li>

<li><p>Code chunks contain <code>R</code> code that is executed when the document is knit to HTML, Word, or another output format. We will ignore the code chunks until a bit later in the Course, when we take on dynamic reporting elements.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3. Edit the exercise file per the following instructions</h4>

<p><strong>YAML Header</strong></p>

<p>In the <code>author</code> field, enter your own Name and Institution surrounded by quotes<br />
In the <code>date</code> field, enter today&rsquo;s date</p>

<p><strong>Text Document</strong></p>

<p>Scholarly publishing requires us to format our text documents to clarify
meaning. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings and subheadings represent document structure, such as Sections</li>
<li>White space represents paragraphs or other text blocks with different content</li>
<li>Block quotes represent text that came from a third-party source</li>
<li>Font styles such as italic and bold represent emphasis</li>
<li>Font styles representing non-proportional text distinguish computer code or technical terms</li>
<li>Lists and Tables represent concisely summarized information or data</li>
<li>Hyperlinks represent references to related information elsewhere within the document, or outside of the document</li>
<li>Inline images illustrate points made in the text</li>
<li>Footnotes represent commentary on the main text</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s add RMarkdown syntax to our report to better communicate it&rsquo;s meaning.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create headings and subheadings by inserting one or more # symbols at the beginning of a line, followed by a space. One # is for a level one header, ## for a level two header and so on.</p>

<p>For this Exercise, assign Level 1, 2, and 3 headers so the exercise file reflects the sections of a Data Management Plan per the Digital Curation Centre&rsquo;s checklist (see the printed model in your packet &ndash; also, the Digital Curation Centre&rsquo;s DMP checklist is available for download at <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/checklist">http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/checklist</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Add emphasis to the text, where appropriate, using single or double asterisks or single or double underscores. Examples of text passages in want of emphasis are:  the phrase &ldquo;Not Applicable&rdquo;; the title of the Project; titles of publications.</p></li>

<li><p>Superscripts and subscripts can be added by surrounding the text with the symbols \^ and ~ , respectively. Find a phrase in the exercise file in want of a superscript and mark it up accordingly. Add an <em>arrow sticky note</em> to your laptop lid.</p></li>

<li><p>Quote two text blocks in the exercise file using the &gt; symbol at the beginning of the line (maybe you remember this from old e-mail programs?)</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a Quote</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Bulleted lists: To make unnumbered bullet lists , just start each line with a single asterisk * or \ - hyphen and a space for the bullet item.  Numbered lists work the same way using 1. 2. 3. or a. b. c.</p>

<p>To make a nested list, indent four spaces below the first level bullet and add another bullet using the + symbol</p>

<p>For this exercise, find the list bullets in need of formatting and add the relevant Rmarkdown syntax. Bullets appear in  &lsquo;Related Policies&rsquo;; &lsquo;Data Being Collected&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Ethics&rsquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>To display technical terminology or other non-proportional text, use the backtick symbol. A single ` on both sides works for short bits, and  three backticks ``` in a separate line above and below is best for larger codeblocks.</p>

<p>Find the name of a computer program, computer file, or computer code in the exercise file and mark it up to represent inline code</p>

<p>Find an example of a code block in the exercise file. When you find one, place a happy sticky note on your laptop lid, and knit the document to html, and go grab a snack!</p></li>

<li><p>Create multiple links to content elsewhere by placing each link text in square brackets [] followed by the link address in round parentheses (). Don&rsquo;t forget to include http:// or https:// at the beginning of the link address.</p></li>

<li><p>Create one inline image by adding an exclamation mark ! in the text, then placing the image name  in square brackets [] followed by the image file address in round parentheses (). Don&rsquo;t forget to include http:// or https:// at the beginning of the link address.</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>TIP: Make sure there is no space between the text in brackets and the address in parantheses!
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Add four footnotes to the text in the exercise (replace the placeholder&rsquo;FN-&lsquo;) by inserting the caret symbol \^ outside of square brackets [], and inserting the footnote content inside those brackets.</p></li>

<li><p>Pandoc supports crude tables created with the pipe | and - symbols to designate cell borders, and the + symbol to control text alignment in a cell. The exercise file provides the makings of a pipe table in the Expected Outputs section. the final row of data needs formatting &ndash; once you complete the table, save the file and knit it to both HTML and Word. If successful, save the file again under the name &lsquo;Base_2013_day3_in.Rmd&rsquo;.</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>Congratulations on completing the first draft of your Reproducible Report!
