## Software Installation

R is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration,
visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use RStudio.
For this workshop you'll need to install both R (version 3.4.3 or newer) and
RStudio on your computer.  

### Windows
Install R by downloading and running this
[.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) file from CRAN. 
Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" 
instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

### macOS
Install R by downloading and running this
[.pkg](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) file from CRAN. Also, 
please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Linux
You can download the binary files for your distribution from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package 
manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base and for 
Fedora run sudo dnf install R). Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).


You also need to download some files for this workshop:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `FSCI-2018-openauthoring`.
2. Download [MAKE A ZIP FILE.zip]({{ page.root }}/files/MAKE A ZIP FILE.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called `data`.
