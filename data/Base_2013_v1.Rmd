## Project Name

***Do Reputable Open Access Journals Require Open Data Sharing? *** 

## Project Description

This study analyzes the submission requirements of the most reputable open access journals to determine whether they require data sharing as a condition of publication. 

According to the Research Data Alliance (RDA) [Data Policy Standardisation and Implementation group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation):

>"the prevalence of research data policies from institutions and research funders is increasing, so publishers and editors are paying more attention to  standardisation and the wider adoption of **data sharing policies**."

This study investigates whether the most reputable Open Access journals have **data sharing polices**. These policies require authors to openly disseminate the data and software underlying their published articles. 

Our methodology builds on the work of Castro et al (Castro et al, 2017) who studied randomly-selected open access journals to determine if they had data sharing policies. Their findings reveal that only a small minority of open access journals have data sharing policies. These findings are consistent with those of other studies (see for example, Vasilevsky et al, 2017).

In this study, we will investigate only the most reputable open access journals to see if they have data sharing policies. Specifically, we will analyze  journals that have attained the Seal of Approval from the [_**Directory of Open Access Journals, DOAJ**_](http://doaj.org) (shown below). We will record whether or not their *Instructions to Authors* includes a data sharing requirement.

![DOAJ Seal of Approval](images/doaj_seal_logo.png)

**DOAJ Seal** journals are considered the most reputable because they: 

>"achieve a high level of openness, adhere to Best Practice and high publishing standards.The Seal is awarded to a journal that fulfills a set of criteria related to accessibility, openness, discoverability, reuse and author rights. It acts as a signal to readers and authors that the journal has generous use and reuse terms, author rights and adheres to the highest level of 'openness'.

# Data Collection

## Existing Data Being Reused

This study relies on the _DOAJ Journal Metadata_ available as a `csv` file download from the [DOAJ website](https://doaj.org/faq#metadata). The `csv` file is updated every 30 minutes.

This data will be read into the open source tool [`OpenRefine`](openrefine.org) to filter it for those journals awarded the DOAJ Seal, and to remove unneeded columns containing the web addresses for journal policies around plagiarism, submission fees, and other urls not related to this study.

The filtered version of the data set will be exported as a new file named `doaj_seal.csv` for importing into analytical software.

A sample of the `doaj_seal.csv` data set is shown below.  

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(doaj_seal, 4))
```


## Data being collected

The `doaj_seal.csv` data set will be copied and enhanced with an additional column for 'Data Policy' which will be filled in during this investigation. The resulting data set will be named `doaj_seal_enhanced.csv`.

Investigators will examine the websites of each journal listed in the `doaj_seal_enhanced.csv` file to determine if a data sharing policy is included in the Instructions to Authors. If no policy is found, the 'Data Policy' column will be marked as 'False'. If a data policy is found, the column will be marked 'True'

### Expected outputs of the project
### Metadata

The journal metadata contained in the project's data sets comes directly from the _Directory of Open Access Journals_. 

The final outputs from the project will be documented in metadata files according to the DataCite DOI registration agency -- see the [DataCite Metadata Schema 4.1] (https://schema.datacite.org/) for specific details. By following this standard metadata format, other researchers (and computers) will be able to find, access, and reuse the outputs from this project by searching the DataCite metadatabase.

# Ethics and Legal Compliance

* No additional ethical or privacy issues arise in this study because both the _DOAJ data_, and the information about data policies for any published journal, are publicly posted online.

* The data provided about journals awarded the *Directory of Open Access Journals* Seal of Approval is distributed under a CC BY-SA license. This license requires that reusers of the data share their derivative data set under the same license. Therefore, the output of this research will be disseminated under the CC BY-SA license. This license adheres to the *Principles and Guidelines of the Research Data Alliance Legal Interoperability Group*, which recommends the use of Creative Commons Attribution licenses to allow the broadest sharing of data while guaranteeing attribution to the data provider.^[https://www.rd-alliance.org/rda-codata-legal-interoperability-research-data-principles-and-implementation-guidelines-now]

# Data collection and standards

All data retrieved for the DOAJ Seal of Approval are downloaded and stored in the open `common separated value` (`csv`) file format.

All data about data policies culled from the web sites of will also be saved and stored in `csv` file format.

Analysis, visualization, and summarization of the study's findings will be performed in the open source software `R` and `RStudio` using the `tidyverse` package. Reports produced from the study will be also be created in `RStudio` using the open source text format `Rmarkdown` and output to `HTML` documents, slides, and `MS Word` documents for submission to funders or publishers. 

All files associated with the project will be maintained under the `Git` version control system and made openly available for download from the Principal Investigator's `GitHub` repository.

*****

# Storage and Backup

During the active phase of the project data will be stored on and backed up to the Research Data Storage Facility (RDSF) at Trieste Polytechnical Institute. This facility represents 2 million pounds of digital resilient storage, with ongoing capital investment. The RDSF is overseen by a steering group of senior research and support staff, which includes the PVC Research. Backup procedures are robust (overnight backup, copies held remotely on tape) and secured access is in place

# Deposit and long-term preservation

After the project conclusion, all research outputs will be assigned Digital Object Identifiers by DataCite to serve as persistent identifiers and to always resolve to the landing page for the project files (metadata, data, code, and reports). 


Additionally, the Research Data Storage Facility (RDSF) at Trieste Polytechnical Institute will undertake to preserve each of the digital outputs mentioned above, for three years beyond the end of the project. Refreshment of storage media will be scheduled as required

****

# Selection and Preservation

The final complete data set `doaj_seal_enhanced` and all published outputs produced based on this data set will be issued Digital Object Identifiers and stored on `GitHub` and `Zenodo`.  All draft versions of project outputs will also be publicly available in Git Hub with unique hashes distinguishing each version that predates the final.

****

# Data Sharing

The data and metadata will be made openly accessible under a CC-BY SA license in the CERN-maintained open access repository `Zenodo`, an open dependable home for the long-tail of science, enabling researchers to share and preserve any research outputs in any size, any format and from any science. ^[Zenodo policies are available online at http://about.zenodo.org/policies/]

# Responsibilities and Resources

The Principal Investigator is responsible for implementing the Data management Plan and ensuring it is reviewed and revised as necessary. She will be responsible for all data collection and recording; for data analysis and visualization; and for maintain all files under version control using `git` and `GitHub`.

The Data Management Specialist assigned to the project as an in-kind contribution from the Trieste Polytechnical Institution Library will be responsible for creating the DataCite metadata documentation for all outputs and ensuring timely DOI registration of each final output. (s)he will also deposit all final outputs to the Zenodo repository and update metadata associated with the DOI as necessary.
